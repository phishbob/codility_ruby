# A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently located at position X
# and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y. The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.

# Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.

# Write a function:

# def solution(x, y, d)
# that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position
# equal to or greater than Y.

# For example, given:

#   X = 10
#   Y = 85
#   D = 30
# the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:

# after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
# after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
# after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100
# Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

# X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
# X â‰¤ Y.
