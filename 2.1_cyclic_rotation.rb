# An array A consisting of N integers is given. Rotation of the array means that each element is shifted
# right by one index, and the last element of the array is moved to the first place. For example, the rotation of
# array A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] is [6, 3, 8, 9, 7] (elements are shifted right by one index and 6 is moved to the
# first place).

# The goal is to rotate array A K times; that is, each element of A will be shifted to the right K times.

# Write a function:
# 		def solution(a, k)
# that, given an array A consisting of N integers and an integer K, returns the array A rotated K times.

# For example, given

#     A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6]
#     K = 3
# the function should return [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]. Three rotations were made:

#     [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] -> [6, 3, 8, 9, 7]
#     [6, 3, 8, 9, 7] -> [7, 6, 3, 8, 9]
#     [7, 6, 3, 8, 9] -> [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]
# For another example, given

#     A = [0, 0, 0]
#     K = 1
# the function should return [0, 0, 0]

# Given

#     A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
#     K = 4
# the function should return [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Assume that:

# N and K are integers within the range [0..100];
# each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000..1,000].
# In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.

# Rotate the array A by k steps
# :param A: an array of integers
# :param K: number of times to shift right
# :return: the rotated array
