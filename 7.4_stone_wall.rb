# You are going to build a stone wall. The wall should be straight and N meters long, and its thickness should be constant;
# however, it should have different heights in different places. The height of the wall is specified by an array H of N
# positive integers. H[I] is the height of the wall from I to I+1 meters to the right of its left end. In particular, H[0] is
# the height of the wall's left end and H[Nâˆ’1] is the height of the wall's right end.

# The wall should be built of cuboid stone blocks (that is, all sides of such blocks are rectangular). Your task is to compute
# the minimum number of blocks needed to build the wall.

# Write a function:

# def solution(h)
# that, given an array H of N positive integers specifying the height of the wall, returns the minimum number of blocks
# needed to build it.

# For example, given array H containing N = 9 integers:

#   H[0] = 8    H[1] = 8    H[2] = 5
#   H[3] = 7    H[4] = 9    H[5] = 8
#   H[6] = 7    H[7] = 4    H[8] = 8
# the function should return 7. The figure shows one possible arrangement of seven blocks.



# Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

# N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
# each element of array H is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].
